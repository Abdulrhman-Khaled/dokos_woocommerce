## :hammer_and_wrench: How the Dokos Woocommerce directory works

Dokos Woocommerce is a Dokos application that allows you to connect your store to Dokos.

WooCommerce is an open-source extension for WordPress to create an online store. It is designed for small and large online businesses using WordPress. 

You  will be able to get your orders from your WooCommerce store and sync them to your Dokos platform.
Dokos will also be able to update your inventory levels in WooCommerce.

## :rocket: Dokos project

Dokos is a 100% open-source management software that is based on ERPNext.

It is distributed under the GPLv3 license.

The 100% web architecture of Dokos allows you to use it in a public cloud as well as in a private cloud.

You can install it on your own servers.

The Dodock framework on which Dokos is installed also allows the installation of other applications. You can thus develop your own customizations, host them on your server and make them evolve in parallel with Dokos, without modifying its source code.
